// ################## ISSUE with react-router-dom v6 in axios interceptor ###########################
// Axios Incerceptor:
// its not possible to clone history.push() in axios interceptor like it was done in  react-router-5. The only possibility is to window.location.href = `${PATHS_CORE.LOGOUT}?reason=session_expired`;
//
// if you use history.push() you will be able to change url but application won't change its UI
//
// using window.location.href will behave like so:
// 1 - you are visiting some PrivateRoute, after refreshToken expirted you yry to update e.g. your avatar
// 2 - update avatar request will return 401 (if accessToken expired) or 403 (if refreshToken expired),
// 3 - axios interceptor will try to refresh accessToken (if avatar request returned 401) but t will get 403 because refreshToken too expired already. That error will be catched in component view function (NOT in PrivateRoute or Redux) and that component will dispaly snackbar with "forbiden - refresh token expired. Log in again"
// 4 - that snackbar will be visible only for a second (even less that 0.5s) because right after that window.location.href from axios interceptor will occur, page will be refreshed completely on /login (user will load website again for /login url)
// 5 - whole app will be downloaded again, logout request from /logout will be sent and you will be redirected to /login. (In /logout you can search for url query e.g. ?reason=refreshtokenexpired and you when redirecting to /login you can pass state object to /login page with that reason so /login page will display snackbar informig  that you were logged out because your session ended (it will be second snackbar)

// Possible solvings (for that snackbar visible for a second):
// #1 - move notistack to REDUX and in every redux action use try/catch  to check if in catch if your refreshToken expired so you won't dispatch action for showing notistack (in try you can dispatch notistack action for success action)
// that way, 1st snackbar won't show but your page will reload anyway

//  OR:

// #2 - not displaying any message from server but creating then in front components? and check if your refresh token got expired in every catch in every component that sends any requests
